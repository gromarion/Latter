Latter!

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/joshmcarthur/Latter.png)](http://travis-ci.org/#!/joshmcarthur/latter)

> Latter is a table-tennis ladder web application used at [3months](http://3months.com). It uses the [Elo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system) rating system to keep track of players' ratings and is fast and easy to use.

### Upgrading

Latter recently moved from Rails 4.0 to 4.1, and as part of this migration, moved the location of the `secret_key_base` configuration from an initializer to the `config/secrets.yml`. In order to make this change, you need to generate a secret using `rake secret`, and set it in your applications configuration in the `ENV` hash as the `SECRET_KEY_BASE` key. See http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/upgrading_ruby_on_rails.html#csrf-protection-from-remote-script-tags


### History

Latter started life as a Sinatra application - in fact, one of the first apps that I had built. Due to it's awful original design and lack of usability though, it fell into disuse.

Following a surge in table tennis playing at 3months, I took a look at what it was trying to do, and refactored the application design and UI to make it more usable.

After a few months of use, and a great deal of extra features, bugfixes and change, I made the decision to switch to Rails, in order to more closely fit with technologies I was comfortable with, to make it easier for contributors to contribute, and because I felt that the Sinatra app would need more and more 'Rails-ness' added to it to continue to grow.

### The Application

Latter is a standard Rails application, based around ActiveRecord. It is 97% covered by specs (although the coverage can be off by a few percentage points), and is very tidily organized.

### Set up

The set up for the application is very simple, and standard for a Ruby on Rails application.

* Clone the repository
* Run bundle install
* Run rake db:setup
* Copy the database YAML file: `cp config/database.yml.example config/database.yml`
* Assuming you're using Faye (which you should in development): `cp Procfile.faye Procfile`
* Start the Rails server: `foreman start`
* Generate a session secret and configure it in your ENV hash on the production server: Run `rake secret` and set the config - for example, on Heroku, run `heroku config:add SECRET_KEY_BASE="[YOUR SECRET]"`

### Deployment

The application will run quite happily on Heroku - that's where it's deployed for 3months. It should also run just fine on any other standard Rails deploy targets.

### Author

Latter was originally developed, and then refactored by [Josh McArthur](http://github.com/joshmcarthur). I continue to vet and suggest improvements on pull requests, and oversee future improvements to keep the application as usable as possible while packing the most cool features in.

### License

I'd like others to get use out of this application, so this application is licensed under the Poetic form of the MIT License.
