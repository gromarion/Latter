    <h2>Game Rules</h2>

    <dl>
      <dt>Service</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
        At the start of service the ball shall be stationary, resting
        freely on the flat, open palm of the server's free hand, behind the end
        line and above the level of the playing surface.
        </p>

        <p>
          The server shall then project the ball near vertically upwards, without
          imparting spin, so that it rises at least 6 inches after leaving the palm
          of the free hand.
        </p>

        <p>
          As the ball is falling from the highest point of it's trajectory, the server
          shall strike it so that it touches first his court and then, after passing over or
          around the net assembly, the receiver's court; in doubles, the ball shall touch
          successively the right half court of server and receiver.
        </p>

        <p>
          The ball and the racket must be above the level of the playing service during the service toss.
        </p>

        <p>
          When the ball is truck, it must be behind the server's end line, but not
          farther back than the part of the server's body, other than his arm, head or leg,
          which is farthest from his end line.
        </p>

        <p>
          If the serve bounces once in the server's court, then twice in the receiver's 
          court, the point goes to the server.
        </p>
      </dd>

      <dt>A good return</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
          The ball, having been served or returned, shall be struck so that it passes over or
          around the net assembly and touches the opponent's court, either directly or after touching the net assembly.

              provided the receiver does not attempt to strike the ball.</li>
